\usage{
gcloud()
}
\description{
Discover the path of the \code{gcloud} executable.
}
\details{
The path to the \code{gcloud} executable can be explicitly
specified, using the \code{GCLOUD_BINARY_PATH} environment
variable, or the \code{gcloud.binary.path} \R option.

When none of the above are set, \code{gcloud} will instead be
discovered either on the system \code{PATH}, or by looking
in the default folders used for the Google Cloud SDK
installation.
