- Add hook to config package to allow for setting and removing a filter

- Automatically call gs_data on all embedded GS URLs

- Generate the app.R file that includes the config hooks (do this in train_cloud)


## Kevin

- For example sake, have some config overrides in the gcloud config

- job_dir and staging_bucket shouldn't go in the config file by default (they are 
  still settable just not in our example)

- How to handle the project directory for packaging (copy, symlink, cleanup, etc.)
    - Never upload gs_data
    - Don't want to upload the job or staging dir (how can we ensure this?)
    - Should we even exppose by default the job_dir and staging dir in the config file
    - Cleanup __init__.py, etc. after we create the python package (on.exit)
    
- train_local and train_cloud should have a ... which forwards into config overrides

- config overrides will be done via a config package filter, which will be set
  in a preamble to source("train.R") within a generated e.g. app.R file.
  
- Get rid of the "train" sub-key

- Provide some down-sampled local versions of data and have them referenced via e.g.
  gs://rstudio-cloudml-demo-ml/census/data/local.adult.test
  
- Pull out `hyperparameters` from config and write a new YAML file with:
    trainingInput:
       hyperparmeters:
  Then pass that to gcloud with --config hyperparmeters.yml
  
- Then in our app.R generated file where we set the config pacakge hook we 
  propagate the command line options/hyperparamters back into the config list
