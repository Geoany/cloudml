### Training/Prediction

- Pull out `hyperparameters` from config and write a new YAML file with:
    trainingInput:
       hyperparmeters:
  Then pass that to gcloud with --config hyperparmeters.yml
  
  Then in our app.R generated file where we set the config pacakge hook we 
  propagate the command line options/hyperparamters back into the config list

- Satisfying R package dependencies of train.R 
   - install.R or requirements.R
   - Use packrat
   - Hybrid where packrat auto-generates dependencies.R (but still allows
     the user to provide their own hand edited dependencies.R)

### Jobs API

- Can we consolidate job_status and job_describe (perhaps just call it job_describe)

- Could we rename job_stream to job_log?


### API 

- Consider whether we should use the REST API for Google Cloud rather
  than the local SDK (https://github.com/rstudio/cloudml/issues/6). 
  It is going to be *very* painful to depend on the Cloud ML Python
  libraries as that will force the use of Python 2 (which might not
  correspond to where the user has already installed tensorflow).

- Sort out all of the gcloud sdk installation / authentication requirements
  for people other than us to use the package and document this well.
  (see: https://cloud.google.com/ml/docs/how-tos/getting-set-up)

- install_gcloud_sdk function (see headless install in 
  https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads)
  
- Ensure that CLOUDSDK_PYTHON points to python 2 not python 3

- `predict_cloudml`

- Job status / enumeration functions return R lists with custom print methods

- Functions for publishing and versioning models?

### Tooling

- Package skeleton function w/ config.yml, train.R, etc.

- Build pane integration: Custom project type exposing various commands

- rstudioapi package making available a version of system that pumps events
  (only required with shell API)
  
- TensorBoard integration
